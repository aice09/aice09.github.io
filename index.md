# Hey there, I'm Carl!

Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m passionate about tech, innovation, and creating cool projects — from building systems in the lab to exploring new ways to bring hardware and software together. Whether it’s designing a systems, optimizing data centers to coding, networking, or sharing insights through my blog, I’m always up to something interesting.

When I'm not tinkering with tech, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new tools or diving deep into a project. Take a look around to see what I’ve been working on, and feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or chat about anything tech-related!
